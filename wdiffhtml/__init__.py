"""
Uses `wdiff`_ to generate a word based *diff* from plain text files.

The results are modified to use HTML `<ins>` and `<del>` tags and can be
wrapped in a full HTML document.


Example
-------

We want a wdiff from two files:

>>> oldfile = 'path/to/old_file.txt'
>>> newfile = 'some/new_version.txt'

To generate it from Python use `generate_wdiff`:

>>> diff = generate_wdiff(oldfile, newfile)

And to wrap it with HTML you can use `wrap_content` (which requires a
`Settings` object):

>>> settings = Settings(oldfile, newfile)
>>> html = wrap_content(diff, settings)

You can combine those two trough the `wdiff` function, which also requires a
`Settings` object and accepts some additional arguments.
